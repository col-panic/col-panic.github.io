abstract = { Sharing data within Grid environments can potentially result in losing control over data usage. If the shared information is medical data laws must be followed, enabling tightly controlled, reconstructible access. To comply with these regulations it must be guaranteed, that each data access and modification is recorded to enable audit trails. The provided solution introduces a new concept for virtualized Data Grid environments which consist of a secure virtual machines, harnessing secure data hosting and indemnifying thorough audit trails by logging each data interaction. This solves the problem of traceability and side-access. }

  abstract = {While harvesting existing resources for the grid is desirable, in
	practice it is rarely achieved due to heterogeneous environments,
	shortcomings of the middleware, and restrictive software specifications.
	Native virtualization allows us to increase the number of grid resources
	by exploiting resources otherwise not accessible. In this paper,
	we present a proof-of-concept implementation of this approach based
	on the VMware virtualization software. It comprises ready-to-use
	virtual machine images for a gatekeeper node or Computing Element
	and job execution nodes or Worker Nodes that can be deployed onto
	an existing computing infrastructure without impairing its primary
	purpose. The prototype was successfully used to integrate an existing
	computing lab into a grid. Our measurements show that the performance
	penalty of native virtualization is small unless heavy use of the
	disk is made and therefore is negligible for many applications.},
